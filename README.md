## Introduction

The Riemann Hypothesis stands as one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics. It proposes a deep relationship between the distribution of prime numbers and the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Our project aims to approach this hypothesis through constructive proofs, leveraging artificial intelligence for enhanced analysis and insights.

## Background

The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line of 1/2 in the complex plane. Despite extensive numerical evidence supporting this claim, a formal proof remains elusive. This project focuses on developing a structured methodology to explore the hypothesis and its implications in analytic number theory.

### Key Concepts

- **Riemann Zeta Function**: A complex function defined for complex numbers, playing a crucial role in number theory.
- **Critical Line**: The line in the complex plane where the real part of the input is 1/2.
- **Constructive Proof**: A proof that not only asserts the existence of a mathematical object but also provides a method to construct it.

## Project Goals

1. **Structured Classification**: Organize and classify various approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis.
2. **AI-Assisted Analysis**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and potential proofs.
3. **Formal Proof Development**: Create formal proofs that can withstand scrutiny and provide clarity to the hypothesis.
